Where did the data come from?
- The Places50 dataset was downloaded from the paper's official repository: [link](https://github.com/tamarott/SinGAN/blob/master/Downloads/user%20study.zip)
- The SIGD16 dataset and all generated images for the two dataset and two methods (SinGAN, GPNN) were extracted from Drop-The-GAN's [user-study pdf](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/gpnn/user_study/AMT.pdf) available at the [project cite](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/gpnn/)
- Style-transfer images and other images were collected from the internet and other style-transfer papers.
